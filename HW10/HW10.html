    <h1>Homework 10: Public Water Sources located in Brownfield Sites</h1>
    <h2>Devin Wilson</h2>
    <h3>My map depicts the location of brownfield sites and public water sources within Miami-Dade county. The high density of public water sources located in and around brownfield sites
        was concerning. Brownfield sites are land which was previously used for industrial purposes and now contains hazardous waste and contamination. These sites can potentially contaminate sources of
        drinking water with pollutants and harm residents.
