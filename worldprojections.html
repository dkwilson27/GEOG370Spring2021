    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <p>I displayed different projections on the world map by using QGIS. My first step was to use the shapfile base layer, then I used the
        Indicatrix Matrix plugin in QGIS. This added latitude and longitude lines onto the base layer as well as Tissot's Indicatrices. Next,
        I chose the projection name and EPSG and added it to the map.

    <h2>WGS84 Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This cylindrical projection is often used by websites like google maps, and is useful due to its accurate representation of 
        distance. This type of map also shows a fairly accurate representation of the shapes of continents. The downside to this map
        is the inaccurate representation of the size of some continents which had to be stretched to fit the shape at the top and bottom.

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This azimuthal map projection gives a relatively accurate depiction of land masses in the world around the center of the map, and begins to distort
        the image at the sides of the ellipse. It shows and equal-area map projection.
    </h3>

    <h2>WGS84 Psuedo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is a cylindrical mercator projection. Like the previous WGS84, it is useful due to its accurate representation of 
        distance and angles. This type of map also shows a accurate representation of the shapes of continents. The downside to this map
        is the inaccurate representation of the size of some continents. The difference between this mercator map and the previous, is that
        there is less distortion along the poles.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel I Projection/Winkel Tripel Projection</h2>
    <h3>This azimuthal map is a cylindrical projection. On this map, the meridian is straight, while the rest of the longitude lines are curved.
        This map is the one adopted by National Geographic because it minimizes area, distance, and direction distortion.
        A downside to this map is that it is not equidistant and although it trys to minimize distortion, there is still some.</h3>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is a cylindrical projection of the globe. Because the poles are straight lines parallel to the equator, there is 
        a large amount of distortion along the top and bottom of the map. This conformal map preserves angles.
    </h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is a conic projection of the globe. This map is beneficial because it portrays earth's areas accurately. The downside to this type of map is the 
        distortion which occurs along the bottom. This type is best used to represent land masses along mid-latitudes. This map is also equidistant along the meridians.

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is an azimuthal projection of the globe. This map is beneficial because it has minimal distortion due to the fact that the meridians extend from the north pole.
        A downside to this map style is that it adds a high level of distortion when not looking at one of the poles.

    <h2>World Winkel II Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is a cylindrical projection of the globe. It is similiar to the Sphere Winkel I projection as they are both Winkel Tripel projections, but this map's longitude lines are less 
        curved and the map features slightly less distortion because of it. This map is the one adopted by National Geographic because it minimizes area, distance, and direction distortion.
        A downside to this map is that it is not equidistant and although it trys to minimize distortion.

    <h2>World Van der Griten I</h2>
    <h3>This map is a cylindrical projection of the globe. It is neither equal-area nor conformal. The idea of this projection is to fit the world into one circle. Due to this it shows distortion 
        at the poles. However, like the Mercator map, this map also preserves distance.
