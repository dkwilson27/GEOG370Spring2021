    <h1>Homework 7: School Enrollement in TX by county</h1>
    <h2>Devin Wilson</h2>
    <h3>My map depicts the number of individuals above the age of 3 enrolled in a k-12 school. The darkest green counties indicate the highest number of enrolled students and the lightest counties have the least amount of enrollement. 
        There was a shockingly low amount of school enrollement throughout the state of Texas than I originally expected to see.
    </h3>
